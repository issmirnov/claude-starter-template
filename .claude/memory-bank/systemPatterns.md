# System Patterns

> **Derived from**: projectbrief.md
> **Purpose**: Documents how the system is architected and key technical patterns

## Architecture Overview
### High-Level Structure
```
[Diagram or description of system architecture]
```

### Component Breakdown
- **[Component Name]**: [Purpose and responsibility]
- **[Component Name]**: [Purpose and responsibility]

### Data Flow
```
[How data moves through the system]
User Input → Component A → Component B → Output
```

## Design Patterns

### Pattern: [Pattern Name]
**Where Used**: [Locations in codebase]
**Why**: [Rationale for this pattern]
**Example**:
```[language]
[Code example demonstrating the pattern]
```

### Pattern: [Additional patterns...]

## Key Technical Decisions

### Decision: [Decision Topic]
- **Context**: [Why this decision was needed]
- **Options Considered**: [Alternatives evaluated]
- **Decision**: [What was chosen]
- **Rationale**: [Why this choice]
- **Consequences**: [Trade-offs, implications]
- **Date**: [When decided]

## Component Relationships

### [Component A] ↔ [Component B]
- **Interaction**: [How they communicate]
- **Dependencies**: [What each needs from the other]
- **Interface**: [API or contract between them]

## Code Organization

### Directory Structure
```
project/
├── [directory]/     # [Purpose]
├── [directory]/     # [Purpose]
└── [directory]/     # [Purpose]
```

### Module Responsibilities
- **[Module Name]**: [What it does, what it doesn't do]

## Conventions

### Naming
- [Naming patterns for files, functions, variables]
- [Conventions for different types of code]

### Error Handling
[How errors are handled consistently across the system]

### State Management
[How application state is managed]

### Testing
[Testing patterns and strategies]

## Critical Paths

### [Critical Function/Feature]
**File**: [path/to/file.ext:line]
**Flow**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**Gotchas**: [Things to watch out for]

## Anti-Patterns
[What should be avoided and why]
